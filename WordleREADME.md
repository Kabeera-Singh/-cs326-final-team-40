## Innovative Idea:

Our project idea is a wordle variant with comments on different words. Instead of a single word each day you solve as many as you want. The words get progressively more difficult. There would also be a social component to our game, in which you will have an account which will track the words you have solved with performance metrics that track with the difficulty of your solved words. You can also like and comment on words that your friends have solved, and compare your user score to theirs.

## Important Components:

Our important components are: Word Lists, Login Data, Difficulty Score of words, Social Networking aspect (Friends, Likes, Comments), Words Each Player Solved.
