## Innovative Idea:

Our project idea is a skribbl.io variant in which there are multiple people who draw and one person who guesses what they are drawing.

#### Synchronous: 

If we can make our application synchronous, we will have people draw and guess at the same time, whoever's drawing the guesser guesses will gain points based on the time it took to guess the word. There are various possible implementations of scoring and guessing that we will choosing from later.

#### Asynchronous:

In this case, each drawer will submit their drawing after a period of time. Then the guesser will try to guess each word, no penalties for time, or the order of guessing the drawings. 

### Important Components:

Our important components are: Point based ranking, Drawing Components, the box for guessing words, Updating the score, Sound effect for each guess, Game Creation with multiple players on different computers.
