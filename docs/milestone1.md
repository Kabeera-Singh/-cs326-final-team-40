## Interactions Between Users and Data

There are three main types of user interaction. The first is when users create/enter a lobby, as they have to create a name, and access the lobby code to join their friends.

The second type is when the drawer has to access the word they have to draw, and draw it.

The third is when the guesser has to recive the drawings and input their guesses as to what it is.
